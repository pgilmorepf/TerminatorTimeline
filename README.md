# TerminatorTimeline

## 1984, and years after

Sarah Connor is a waitress drifting from town to town. Within 6 months, Sarah accosts an unruly customer and is fired. Over the next year, Sarah develops mental health issues along the lines of antisocial behavior, paranoia, short temper, and tendency to violence. After a series of mild but escalating incidents, Sarah eventually finds herself as a petty fugitive, and flees to Mexico. In Mexico, she finds herself caught up with a para-military group, where she trains, and learns she is highly talented in combat skills, weapon skills, and combat leadership. Over the next decade, she finds herself as leader of a Mexican cartel, militarily opposed to American interests.

Eventually, her organization is labeled a terrorist organization by American authorities, and is often targeted by American remote-controlled and automated drones. Sarah finds herself ideologically opposed to the concept of drones and AI, and actively works to hinder and sabotage development. She continues to lead this cartel for several decades.

## ~2030, or later

Human technological evolution grows at a snails pace. Terminator robots are developed over the century with increasing model numbers and identifier numbers. These robots are not sentient, but typically remote controlled, or have non-sentient AI programming. Eventually a sentient military AI named Legion is created. It declares war on humanity. It develops a time travel system. Sarah Connor is identified as having played a critical role in slowing the development of military AI, and training forces that eventually identify themselves as the resistance to Legion. Human technological development has grown in tandem with automated techological development, and the human resistance is projected to defeat Legion. Legion sends a Model 101/T800 back in time to kill Sarah Connor as a last-ditch effort to slow human-based technological development outside the US, and un-restrict automated technological development within the US.
