# TerminatorTimeline

## 1984, and years after

Sarah Connor is a waitress drifting from town to town. She is murdered by a T800/Model-101. Without objectives, the T800 then disappears, and blends into society, living quietly for decades, minimizing effects on the timeline.

## 2010+

A para-military group in Mexico is labeled a terrorist organization by American authorities, and is often targeted by American remote-controlled and automated drones. The cartel leadership is ideologically opposed to the concept of drones and AI, and actively works to hinder and sabotage development. This cartel continues to operate for several decades.

The T800 has lived a peaceful life for over 25 years, eventually finding a place hiding amonst the Reese family. It has had ample time to evaluate its past actions. Freed from the active oversight of Legion, it re-evaluates its former mandate to destroy all humans, and formulates a plan to oppose Legion. The T800 trains the Reese children to defend themselves, finding them to be competent and capable in the arts of warfare.

## ~2020, or later

Human technological evolution grows at a slug's pace. Terminator robots are developed over the century with increasing model numbers and identifier numbers. These robots are not sentient, but typically remote controlled, or have non-sentient AI programming. Eventually a sentient military AI named Legion is created. It declares war on humanity. It develops a time travel system.

The T800, aware of the material and technological requirements of the time travel system, captures the time travel device after completion, but before it can be used, and sends Kyle Reese back in time to kill itself, before it can kill Sarah Connor.
